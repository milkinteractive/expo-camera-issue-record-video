# Expo Camera Issue – Record Video Demo

This repository demonstrates automatic video recording with **expo-camera**.

## Prerequisites

* Node.js **16** (`.nvmrc` provided)
* Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
* Xcode / Android Studio if you intend to run on iOS or Android emulators/devices

## Installation

```bash
# clone repo then
npm install
```

## Running the App

```bash
# iOS simulator
npm run ios

# Android emulator/device
npm run android

# Web (uses your browser camera)
npm run web
```

## What Happens

1. On mount we request camera permissions.
2. When the camera becomes **ready** the app automatically starts recording using `recordAsync()`.
3. After **3 seconds** it stops and logs the resulting video object in the dev console.

Feel free to adjust recording duration or add UI controls in `App.tsx`.

## Project Structure

└── README.md        # this file
```

## Troubleshooting

* **Permissions denied** – make sure the simulator/device/browser has camera access.
* **Camera not available on web** – some browsers block insecure origins; use HTTPS or `expo-preview`.
